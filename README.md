# BangazonSite

Welcome to the BangazonSite! 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine

### Installing

First, you'll need to clone down the repo into a directory. Open your terminal and enter

```
git clone git@github.com:the-devatstating-chickens/BangazonSite.git
```
Open up your editor which we prefer to be Visual Studio, through the terminal with the command

```
cd BangazonSite
```

```
start BangazonSite.sln
```

Now, you'll be taken to Visual Studio with the project opened up. The next thing you'll want to do is to go to Tools and open the NuGet Package Manager and 
select the Package Manager Console. Once that is open, type in and enter Update-Database. Once the database has been successfully updated, go to View and select
SQL Server Object Explorer. Select your local database and click refresh. Now, for the fun part! Let's run our application. Make sure you've selected BangazonSite.

###### You are now ready to use our BangazonSite. 


## User instructions
The user will be presented with a list of most recently added items on the Bangazon platform. Would you like to know more about an item? Just give
it a click. Gotcha! You can't do much of anything until you log in. You may sign in as an existing user or create a new user. If you want to log in
as an administrator, enter admin@admin.com and your creative and secure password, Admin8*. Now you've got access to the glory of Bangazon. You'll be able to view
whatever you clicked on. Once logged in, you may view products and their details, add them to your cart, create a new product to sell, view product categories,
review your products and their current inventory/amount sold, and check out your profile settings.


### We hope you enjoyed our app! :)
